# n-Queens-Problem
My solution to the n-Queens problem 

This repository is about my solutions to the n-Queens problem. 

The first solution can solve the problem with n = 150 in more less 6 hours, I haven't tried with a larger value to n.

Note:
- It is 100% accurate
- Slow because of list comprehensions
- Slow at the begging but then faster
- It doesn't have comments and most of it is in spanish (noob dev) 

The POO solution 

Note:
-I think is faster than the other but sometimes I don't know why It just fail with one square but it actually put correctly 99 queens out of 100 
-English and commented :)
-HavenÂ´t tried it

Next goal do a solution with pandas
